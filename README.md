Angular, Backbone, Ember, and many other libraries provide model layers which are AJAX driven. While variations on these models exist they are usually only useful if you're using the entire framework they are built to work with.

Marilyn is a WebSocket driven, real time, evented, model layer. It has Socket.IO support out of the box and can work with any framework, or by itself if you just need more data abstraction.

**This library is considered Alpha level.**
**As of right now it shouldn't be used in production.**
